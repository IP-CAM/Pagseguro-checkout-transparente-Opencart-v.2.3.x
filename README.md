PagSeguro-Checkout-Transparente
PagSeguro Checkout Transparent Module for OpenCart

What is the project.
The "PagSeguro Transparente" project was created to facilitate the purchase for the end user. The project when installed has the function of making the purchase easier as it 'eliminates' the famous 'redirect'.

Benefits
Payment made entirely on your e-commerce or website
The customer stays in your e-commerce environment or website during the entire purchase process, without the need for registration or intermediate payment pages.

1-click purchase
On the first purchase, you can choose to save your customer's credit card details. With that, the customer will be able to buy again on his e-commerce or website without having to enter all the payment details. This feature makes the purchase process much simpler and faster.

Increase your sales conversion
You can have an increase of up to 30% in the conversion of your sales, since the number of steps in your checkout will be reduced and your customers will not be directed to pages external to your e-commerce or website.

Data security made by PagSeguro
Your customers' payment details are sent directly from the browser to PagSeguro. Without going through your servers, you don't have to worry about the security of this information.

Correction with accentuation problems
